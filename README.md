# Data Engineering Project Progress

## AWS Lambda Functions

I have already completed learning AWS Lambda functions as part of my personal projects, where I used Lambda for serverless applications and data processing. Additionally, I am currently learning Lambda functions in my Saylani Mass IT Training Cloud Data Engineering course to deepen my understanding of serverless architectures and cloud-based data pipelines.
